I read some books last year. 
I already wrote about the Hugo award books that I read, so I won't belabor the point.
It was mostly fiction (science fiction / fantasy at that) with one ( I think? ) non-fiction in there. 
I think I'd like to read more non fiction but really cant get around to it so much really. 


Next year ( this really really) I think I'll try and read the hugo nominees again, there was a lot of interesting stuff there, but I'm not too sure what else to look at.


Here's a table of the books read, roughly sorted by order in which I read them:
